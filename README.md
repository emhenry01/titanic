The goal of this repository (notebook and csv file) is to come up with the best model (out of a few possibilities) that will use the Titanic disaster data to predict the likelihood that a passenger survived (or not).

By analyzing the available data the model will return a prediction of 1 for "survived" and 0 for "deceased".

The idea is to take the available data and split it into two sets: "training" and "testing"; the prediction model will be built on the training set while the testing set will be used to measure the accuracy of the model.

The source of the data used for this exercise is kaggle.com
